# Travel_Buddy_Application
The proposed system is a mobile-based application on travel over any city in India. 
The rise in popularity of smartphones also creates a market potential for mobile tourism services, boosting their market share and driving up visitor demand for high-quality services. The most effective way to help tourists travel is by using these mobile tourism applications. The application makes it simple for users to find routes to unfamiliar locations. Tourists could benefit from extra information about places to visit, including actual photographs of the hotspots in addition to the descriptive language that is provided.
The application will enable tourists to plan their itinerary. They could also check amenities that is readily available surrounding those hotspots including entertainment, food and beverages, places of interest as well as other nearby hotspots. Thus, as compared to a printed map, which has been 
widely used by tourists, the use of a mobile application would be definitely effective, convenient and beneficial for the tourists. 
The work done in the application attempts to provide an interactive solution to this shortcoming that is to develop an effective tourism application for tourists of diverse travel intentions to any city in India. The application is ultimately targeted to elevate tourist knowledge of hot spots in India.
